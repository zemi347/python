Answer:
 
 object-oriented programming:

                An object-oriented programming language (OOPL) is a high-level programming language based on the object-oriented model. To perform object-oriented programming, one needs an object-oriented programming language.

Examples of object-oriented programming languages include Java, C++ and Smalltalk.
