Question 4:
Define the following terms:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Attribute
4. Behavior

Answer:

1: Class:

A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class.

2: Object:

Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stress on objects. Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.


3: Attribute:

An attribute is defined as a quality or characteristic of a person, place, or thing. Real life individuals and fictional characters possess various attributes. ... There is a difference between attributes and traits, but it is slight and some characteristics could be considered either an attribute or a trait.
As an object-oriented language, Python provides two scopes for attributes: class attributes and instance attributes.

4: Behavior:

Behave is behavior-driven development, Python style. Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
