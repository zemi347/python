Question 3:
Differentiate between function and method?

Answer:

Difference between method and function

1. Simply, function and method both look similar as they perform in almost similar way, but the key difference is    the concept of ‘Class and its Object‘. 

2. Functions can be called only by its name, as it is defined independently. But methods can’t be called by its        name only, we need to invoke the class by a reference of that class in which it is defined, i.e. method is          defined within a class and hence they are dependent on that class.
